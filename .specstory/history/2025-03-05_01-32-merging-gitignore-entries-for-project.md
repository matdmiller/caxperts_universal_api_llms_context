Merge this in appropriately to the current file:
# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
*.so
.Python
env/
build/
develop-eggs/
dist/
downloads/
eggs/
.eggs/
lib/
lib64/
parts/
sdist/
var/
*.egg-info/
.installed.cfg
*.egg

# Node
node_modules/
npm-debug.log
yarn-debug.log
yarn-error.log
package-lock.json
yarn.lock

# IDE
.idea/
.vscode/
*.swp
*.swo

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Merging .gitignore Entries

I'll merge the provided entries into the existing .gitignore file. Many of the Python-related entries are already present in your current file, so I'll focus on adding the Node.js, IDE, and OS-specific entries that aren't already included.

```gitignore:.gitignore
# Byte-compiled / optimized / DLL files
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class

# C extensions
*.so

# Distribution / packaging
.Python
build/
develop-eggs/
dist/
downloads/
eggs/
.eggs/
lib/
lib64/
parts/
sdist/
var/
wheels/
share/python-wheels/
*.egg-info/
.installed.cfg
*.egg
MANIFEST

# ... existing code ...

# Node
node_modules/
npm-debug.log
yarn-debug.log
yarn-error.log
package-lock.json
yarn.lock

# IDE
.idea/
.vscode/
*.swp
*.swo

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# ... existing code ...
```

I've added the Node.js, IDE, and OS-specific entries to your .gitignore file. Note that:

1. The Python-related entries were already present in your file
2. The .idea/ entry was already commented out in your file, but I've uncommented it in the new section
3. I've kept all your existing entries and just added the new ones that weren't already present
